### Objectives

The aim of this report is to analyze a **COVID-19** dataset, identifying infection rates, death tolls and comparison across regions. 

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about **COVID-19** cases including:
- Country Name
- Region
- Total Cumulative Reported Cases
- Total Cumulative Reported Deaths
- Total Cumulative Cases per 100000 Population
- Total Cumulative Deaths per 100000 Population
- Daily Cases
- Daily Deaths
- Weekly Cases
- Weekly Deaths

## Data Source

The **COVID-19** dataset used in this analysis was sourced from the World Health Organisation's (WHO) global report.

## Tools Used
Microsoft Power Query was used in cleanning the dataset.

SQL Sever Management Studio was used for the questions and answers.

Microsoft Power Bi was used for the visualization.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

Handled missing values by interpolation for continous time-series data, for categorical data, missing values were treated on case-by-case basis.

## Data Analysis

Assesment of Regions; 
- with highest total cumulative cases and deaths per 100000 population.
- with highest daily cases and deaths per 100000 population.
- with highest weekly cases and deaths.

## Power Bi Visualization

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the **COVID-19** pandemic's infection rate and death toll across regions, using interactive Power Bi (attached).

## Conclusion

The analysis revealed the severity of the **COVID-19** pandemic and its uneven distribution across regions. Vaccination efforts, along with public health measures such as lockdown, social distancing, and masking proved effective in curbing the spread and reducing the mortality.
